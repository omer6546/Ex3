## Introduction: 
#### In this Project i implemented directed weighted graph in python and compared run time with similar code in java.
#### this project has three parts:
implement a directed weighted graph interface by a data structure which i think is the right one. 

implement algoriyhms interface to support the common uses for that graph.

compare three algoriyhms(shortest path, connected components and connected component) run time and efficiency between my code in python, NetworkX module in python and java cdoe based on previeous project.
## Main purpose:
#### create efficient Algorithms, and learn python.
